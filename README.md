**AI Chatbot for PDFs & YouTube – Built with FastAPI & LLaMA 3**

I developed a smart AI chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs and YouTube links to chat with the content. 
This project combines a clean UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a FastAPI-powered backend using LLaMA 3-70B instruct for intelligent responses. 
It leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and vector databases (Qdrant/Pinecone) for fast, relevant data retrieval.

**Key Features:**

✅ Multi-document support (Upload multiple PDFs & YouTube links)

✅ Fast response time (Optimized with WebSockets)

✅ Memory retention (Improved conversation flow)

✅ Efficient retrieval (Using vector stores like Qdrant/Pinecone)

**Tech Stack & Skills:**

Backend: FastAPI, Python, LangChain

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI Models: LLaMA 3-70B Instruct

Vector Stores: Qdrant, Pinecone

Deployment: Docker, Cloud Services
